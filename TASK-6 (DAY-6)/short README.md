Password Strength Evaluation Task Report
Steps Followed:
Create multiple passwords with varying complexity (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, symbols, and
passphrases). Test each password using a password strength checker tool. Record the strength
rating and estimated crack time for each password. Analyze feedback from the tool to identify what
makes a password stronger. Research common password attacks (brute force, dictionary) and
understand how complexity affects security. Summarize findings into best practices for creating
secure passwords.

Observations:
Passwords with more than 16 characters and mixed case, symbols, and numbers score the
highest. Short passwords, even with symbols, are relatively easy to crack. Passphrases can be
both memorable and strong when they are long and unique. Random character combinations tend
to be more secure but harder to remember.
Best Practices:
Use at least 16 characters. Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols. Avoid using
dictionary words alone. Consider long, unique passphrases for better memorability. Never reuse
passwords across different accounts.
Common Password Attacks:
Brute Force: Trying all possible combinations until the correct one is found. Longer and more
complex passwords take exponentially longer to crack. Dictionary Attack: Using common words or
leaked password lists. Avoid using whole dictionary words without modifications.
Summary:
Password complexity directly increases the time and effort required to crack it. Using a mix of
character types, longer lengths, and unique patterns significantly enhances security. Passphrases
offer a balance between memorability and strength, while short, predictable passwords are highly
vulnerable
